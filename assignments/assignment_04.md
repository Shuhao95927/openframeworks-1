### Due: Sunday @ 12pm - Points: 5
### Assignment

Make a new project which draws only the object with a face from the last assignment.

Move the shapes you used to create the face (adding more if necessary) to express:
1. happiness
2. sadness
3. surprise
4. anger

In setup() set your framerate to 60 fps and set all shapes to their initial locations.

Move all shapes to their final destinations in 1 second and show each emotion for 2 seconds in a slideshow using ofGetFrameNum and the c++ modulo operator.

Submit the url of the dir to canvas
