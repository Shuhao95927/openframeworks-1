### Assignment
## Due: Sunday May 10th @ 12pm - Points: 15

  Your goal is to relate a book or event narrative using primitive shapes, colors, sound and movement.  All of the
code should be bespoke (no functionality copied from online sources). It is highly recommended that you choose a story you are invested in telling and feel strongly about.  The experience itself should require around 5 minutes from the user.
