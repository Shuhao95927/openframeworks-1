### Due: Sunday @ 12pm - Points: 5
### Assignment
Create a new project using the code from the last emotion assignment.

Remove all timer related changes and movement.

Create a UI with the following:
* An ofxFloatSlider to control the sound volume 
* An ofxButton to rotate between which emotion is being displayed
* An ofxVec2Slider to change the x,y of all shapes being drawn
* An ofxColorSlider to select the color of one shape in the drawing
* An ofxIntSlider shape movement (degree of emotion)
* Appropriate labels

## Questions
What are the first 4 arguments of the slider setup method?

From the guiExample .h file, what types of sliders are available?

If the difference between them is in their return value, what do they return and how does this affect the values you can pass to setup?
