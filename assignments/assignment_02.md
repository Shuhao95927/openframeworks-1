### Information
Github Repositories and Openframeworks Projects

[Make a github account](http://gitthub.com)

Make a repository called "openframeworks".

Clone your repository to your computer.

Add a .gitignore file to the root of your repository containing the following:
```
*~
*#
*.zip
*.tar.gz

# visual studio

*.VC.db

# osx / xcode / openframeworks

.DS_Store

DerivedData

obj
**/bin/*
!**/bin/data/
*Debug.app
```
Commit and push the file to the repository


[Create a new project in ](http://openframeworks.cc/learning/01_basics/create_a_new_project/) under the correct assignment/yourName folder.

Using a terminal:

```
  1. cd YourNewProject		: Type "cd ", drop your new project folder in the terminal, and hit enter.
  2. git add .			: Tells git to track all project files (Repeat steps 1,2 if you add new files)
  3. write some code	
  4. git commit -am "Message"	: Tells git to create a snapshot of the project.  Use a descriptive message!
  5. git status			: Tells you what git wants to change.  Verify this before pushing!
  6. git pull			: Downloads changes from your classmates
  7. git push			: Uploads changes you've made
```
You can iterate over these steps as often as needed. Every time you get a new part of your project working you should commit it so you can return to it later if needed.

For every project, some IDE files will **never** upload.  This is intentional as all environments generate huge files which don't relate to the app functionality.  The only files you need are in the "src" and (maybe) "data" directories.
