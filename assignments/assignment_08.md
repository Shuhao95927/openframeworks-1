Make the request and print it out.

Print out specifically: The current time (in epoch format), sunriseTime, sunsetTime, temperature, and two other values of your choice.

Use integer division to calculate and print the current month, hour, and minute.

Translate 4 values from the above request (or any other if you are adventurous) to your scene.

Create an appropriate GUI to manually set each value.
