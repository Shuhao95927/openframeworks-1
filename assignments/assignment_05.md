### Due: Sunday @ 12pm - Points: 5
### Assignment
Create a new project using the code from the last assignment.

Currently emotions change over 1 second and the face is held for 1 second.

Starting at each change, play a sound that you either created or downloaded (with attribution in your .md file).  Make sure each sound is < 2 seconds.

Since this project uses sound, you will have to upload a youtube file for your README.md .
