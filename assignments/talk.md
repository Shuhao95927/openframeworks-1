Artist Presentations:

Every group will select a week to present about an artist who uses code in their work. Note: it’s not necessary that the artist use openFrameworks but every person in the group should be interested in the person chosen.  The research should be complete and authoritative.  It is your job to present the value of the work/process to us and lead a class conversation.

Consider the following questions:
* Why did you choose this artist?
* What are some examples of their work?
* What is the cultural significance/effect of their work?
* How does use of technology make them more effective?
* What kind of technology did the artist use? (JavaScript? Arduino? Processing? openFrameworks? Other non code resources?)
* What kind of techniques did the artist use? (tactile interfaces, sound, projection, machine learning)
* Why is it necessary that the artist use code? (ie: particularly if it’s non‐interactive, could it have been achieved with traditional or linear media?)
* What do they do well? What do they do poorly? What do you like/dislike?
* How do they connect to themes in this course?

Bring supporting materials (printed materials, games, presentations, pictures, video, code) that will help us understand your arguments.

Note: The goal of this is to introduce the class to new media artists and to encourage critical thought.  Just running through the slides in a deck will likely be pretty tedious.  Think about how you can bring your excitement regarding the chosen artist to us.
