### Assignment
## Due: Sunday May 10th @ 12pm - Points: 15

  Your goal is to create a simple game.  All of the code should be bespoke (no functionality copied
from	online sources). Focus on simple mechanics and interactions and how you can engage with a user through a coherent visual and auditory style including but not limited to character creation and setting.  You can optinally go for a typical score-based game or interactive story style experience.

## Examples

Look on video sites for playthroughs of:
* Sushi Cat: Coherent visual/auditory experience
* Flappy Bird: Simple low interaction 
* PacMan: Low resource, simple color pallette
* Canabalt: Low concept excellent soundtrack
* Pinocchio: Interactive fiction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRXHqFv365Y
