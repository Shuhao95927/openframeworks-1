## Reading Groups
In groups of 3-4 you will be responsible for a 20min in-class talk about a digital artist.  Your group should distribute documentation (themes, examples) and have illustrative activities.

[Talk](assignments/talk.md)

## Grading

 55pts - Weekly Assignments 11x5pts

 45pts - Projects 3x15pts

100pts - Total

## Late Work

Up to 24hrs = Max Score 75%

Up to 48hrs = Max Score 50%

Beyond 48hrs = Max Score 0%

Note:  Many weeks will rely on the code submitted from the previous week.  Failing to submit work for one week will therefore have the potential to increase the work for following submissions. 

## Projects
During the semester there will be three larger engagements which will be iterated upon and due in the last week.  Unlike the weekly assignments which fit under the rubric of technical demonstrations, the end projects will require design oriented outcomes.  These are:

* An ablity to translate concepts into concrete artifacts
* Understanding of what a Design Choice is and its importance
* Understanding of why you make such choices
* That you can research in a variety of ways
* Articulation of design tensions & touchpoints
* That you can triage your time, goals, and other resources
