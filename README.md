# openframeworks
Openframeworks class agenda, examples, and content

## Reading Groups
In groups of 3-4 you will be responsible for a 20min in-class summation of the readings for the week.  Your group should distribute documentation (themes, examples) and have illustrative activities.

## Grading

 55pts - Weekly Assignments 11x5pts

 45pts - Projects 3x15pts

100pts - Total

## Late Work

Up to 24hrs = Max Score 75%

Up to 48hrs = Max Score 50%

Beyond 48hrs = Max Score 0%

Note:  Many weeks will rely on the code submitted from the previous week.  Failing to submit work for one week will therefore have the potential to increase the work for following submissions.
